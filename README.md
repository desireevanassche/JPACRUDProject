# JPACRUDProject Plant Database

### Overview

House of Plants Botanical Database is a full-stack web application implements skills learned in JPA and Spring Boot. The main goal of this project is to implement CRUD efficiently while gaining hands on experience with Java full-stack development.

### Application & Use
This botanical data base allows you, the user, to Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects though a web gui. In this application you will interact with forms, buttons, and various web pages that allow you to manipulate the database.

### Goals to Return
I found that there was not enough time in a weekend to learn and do all of the things I would have like and look forward to returning to this project to enhance and improve it at a later date.

#### Goals
* Increase styling & readability  
* Increase functionality
* Finish view all page
* Add JavaScript
* Add a user login
* Implement a search bar that can search by keyword & id

### Technologies Used
* Java
* JPA Java Persistence Application
* Spring Bootstrap
* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* Atom
* Github
* HTML / CSS

### Lessons Learned

#### Whitepage Labels
Whitepage errors were the most common issue I ran into during this project. They are so common and often caused by a missing link in the back end where the controller, DAO, and program are not mapped properly. These errors have many causes but mismatch parameter names and typos seemed to be the largest offenders of this project.

#### Community is Important in Coding
Having the opportunity to talk through my own errors and issues as well as other students created more productivity and created a strong sense of community. While this project was not a group assignment I was fortunate to have a good group of peer that I could work with. Having people to talk through problems with, getting another set of eyes on errors, and providing an another set of eyes for others allowed me to spot mistakes in my own code more efficiently and build meaningful relationships that make the tough times so much better.

#### Styling Changes
While I wouldn't have called myself a pro at CSS & HTML I definitely felt comfortable in those areas prior to this project. I really struggled through getting my stylesheet to connect to my pages and this caused serious delays. After a long struggle I found that using the include file tag at the top of a jsp file allowed me to call in a jsp style sheet that implements CSS as well as JavaScript.
